  　Your enthusiasm for the project and the clear understanding of the science was awesome! Your effort in thinking about how to implement the project is also great! The entrepreneurial section of your project is exemplary and serves as a great model for others.

  **Constructive Feedback**

  　Please try to consider how your model will directly guide and inform your work to increase its effectiveness. Another point I want to highlight is that you might need to consider doing more thorough research into existing literature and current solutions as it’s necessary. For instance, the monthly application of pesticide should be examined in relation to its degradation time.

  　This is an amazing idea, and the progress you show is really promising. I hope you can explore more about this project. I invite you to think about other applications it may have.

  　As you mentioned in the judging session, it is important to repeat the experiments that are presenting strange results. Also, when you are measuring bacterial proliferation, I suggest you measure during the exponential phase. If you wait 48 hours, the cells will be under stress and may start to do strange things.

  　The project sounds promising. The wiki is well-designed and your wiki documentation is clear and thorough. The experimental, modeling, and entrepreneurship, and integration of Human Practices are very impressive. Overall, your project can serve as an inspiring example for future teams in the iGEM community and beyond. Keep up the excellent work!

  **Constructive Feedback**

  　The project is well-designed with great potential. However, you need to complete part documentation on the registry to ensure reusability by future teams. Please make sure to add measurement/modeling data for each genetic part. Examples of well-documented parts are BBa_K863006 and BBa_K863001.

  　Dear MOVErs, you demonstrate great scientific insight in leveraging host-produced microvesicles as your core strategy. I think this approach holds a lot of potential as it offers good flexibility through the potential inclusion of various surface proteins. This innovative solution stands out for its elegant simplicity and I think it might have indeed significant advantages over traditional methods, potentially advancing the field. Your strategic thinking in choosing this adaptable platform technology showcases both scientific creativity and practical consideration of real-world applications. You are very thorough in your communication and comprehensive documentation of the project, which clearly demonstrates your professionalism and attention to detail. Well done! I love seeing how passionate you are about using science to make a difference. Keep following that passion - it’s people like you who come up with the innovations that change the world for the better. Keep exploring, keep asking questions, and keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

  To further strengthen your great project, I would recommend several areas for development: First, consider including a thorough patent evaluation to understand the intellectual property landscape around your technology. This would be valuable for potential future applications of your work. In your presentation, you could clarify your primary target pest organisms a bit better. I see some ambiguity between targeting insects (in your video) versus fungi (in your wiki). Regarding the delivery strategy, I would encourage you to do a more detailed analysis of the expected uptake efficiency in your target organisms. A core strength of your design is flexibility through adjustable surface proteins and modifiable RNA content. The cellular entry mechanisms might vary significantly between different pest types (such as insects versus fungi). For instance, relying solely on surface proteins for RNA delivery into insects like bugs or aphids might not be sufficient - consider exploring additional delivery strategies or modifications that could enhance uptake efficiency.

  　Your project had extremely well-developed Human Practices, and I really liked seeing the implementation of the Maturity Model, along with the ISO Innovation Management System. Your development using these techniques is an example to other teams about how to approach Human Practices in a systematic manner. Similarly, your Entrepreneurship and Modelling efforts were exceptionally well implemented and described on the wiki. They clearly fed back into the design of your project and its outcomes.

  **Constructive Feedback**

  　I think the wet-lab aspect of the project is the main disappointment, and largely the experiments were not well-described on your wiki. It was unclear from your results why several of the experiments failed, and some of the experimental conclusions written on the wiki do not logically follow from the results. Experimental repeats and greater consultation with technical experts would be core to taking the project forward.

  Judge 6

  **Positive Feedback**

  　I was quite impressed by the project selection and the technical progress made by the team. Specifically, the iteration cycles were well thought out with sound engineering principles.

  **Constructive Feedback**

  　While you participated in the Lean Launchpad program, I was looking for key insights that allow you to better understand the problem-solution fit, and as such, what improvements you can make in your project.
