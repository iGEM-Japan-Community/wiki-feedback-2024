   　UTokyo’s iGEM 2024 project combines miRNA detection with CRISPR-Cas3 technology, demonstrating the potential for a low-cost, portable diagnostic tool for early glaucoma screening. This approach not only enhances accessibility to diagnostic tools but may also improve overall patient care, particularly in resource-limited areas.

   　Despite the project’s innovative approach, using tear-based biomarkers for glaucoma diagnosis faces challenges in terms of accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the feasibility and market adoption may be hindered by high development costs and time investment, impacting its practical application value.

   　Your innovative use of tear fluid for glaucoma detection is an outstanding example of forward-thinking science that addresses real-world challenges. I especially appreciate how you've considered the potential to expand POIROT’s applications beyond glaucoma. Keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible—your work could have a profound impact on both diagnostics and healthcare accessibility. Fantastic effort and vision!

   　While the concept of detecting glaucoma biomarkers in tear fluid is innovative, the team could provide more detail on how they plan to scale the technology for real-world use. Specifically, discussing challenges related to manufacturing, the cost-effectiveness of the system, and its potential accessibility in clinical settings would strengthen the project’s feasibility and impact.

   　The team clearly identifies the issue of microplastic pollution and its impact on the environment, which is a pressing global concern. The team's objectives, including the development of a novel biological system to degrade microplastics, are concise and achievable. The team's proposal to use a genetically engineered bacterium to degrade microplastics is an innovative and promising approach.

   　The project description could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the long-term sustainability of the proposed interventions. This should include considerations of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and the potential for wider adoption. The team should address how they plan to ensure the continued success and impact of their solutions beyond the scope of the iGEM competition.

   　First of all, congrats on finishing an iGEM project! You can be proud of yourselves. I really enjoyed your wiki. It was very easy to navigate and I could find all the information I was looking for. Your modeling was very impressive. It's great that you managed to model all the kinetics & integrate that in your project - that's not a given for many iGEM teams. Nice job during the judging session too. You clearly knew what you were talking about so kudos on this. The engineering part was very clear and well described. That's a super important skill to have in science, so congrats on getting this right. Very nice job on the HP. You're one of the few teams to have shown this just like an engineering cycle which I think is very thoughtful and pertinent.

   　Some of your choices in the wiki were sometimes not very clear - it was very well cleared during the judging sessions but we did not have time to go through everything sadly. Your education work was a bit confusing. For instance, it was not clear why you put a large emphasis on gene editing whereas your work focused on detection. Some of your engineering cycles were not, indeed, cycles. It's not really enough to put the labels "Design, Build, Test, Learn", you really have to show what the learnings were during the next design cycle. I really want to put the emphasis on the word "cycle" here :) Also, always contextualize your models so that you can easily understand why you are doing these modeling and why it is important. For instance, it's not always clear that results from MD simulations can directly reflect on the "real-world" experiments.

   　The level of progress in this project, particularly given the shear complexity of miRNAs, and the overall effort, is amazing. I was really impressed by the team's ability to identify and address problems through integrative engineering cycles, such as those used to correctly distinguish between negative controls and 1fM. This was a critical step in assuring the device's feasibility downstream.

  　**Constructive Feedback**
   
   　With respect to the selection of target miRNAs one huge issue with their clinical use is finding disease specific miRNAs. I see that the next steps will be applying this system to tear fluids which is great, however it could be also be wise to do a deeper analysis of the tear fluid samples first in an attempt to find glaucoma specific miRNAs. This would then would make POIROT an even more accurate and valuable device.

   　The judges were impressed with your updates. You were on the right track with your question and answering session, specifically I appreciate the answer about why you chose age of respondents for your survey: It was practical!

  　**Constructive Feedback**
   
   　I highly recommend specifically seeking guidance from social scientists and educators the next time you want to develop a bi-directional and successful education plan to be a part of your integrated HP How do you recommend iGEMers doing education recruit a diverse and representative group of people to engage with their education materials? What kinds of communities and people do you imagine to be the recipients of such education? Be more specific than “the general public.” (I hope to hear about the differences in affluent communities, or high concentrations of professionals in institutions vs working class areas.)
