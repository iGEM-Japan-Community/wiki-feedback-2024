You have worked on a relevant project for the whole world. Your parts were described in great detail. This is a great example for future iGEM teams to build further upon. The scientific background is very clear. You explained the chassis choice very clear, integrating native proteins into your system. You also considered different conditions for your bioreactos. Your results were analyzed with great details. I am very impressed by the large ammount of DBTL cycles as well.

**Constructive Feedback**

Your hardware system could have been explained in more detail. I would have liked to see a clearer description on how you integrated feedback from experts in your experimental setup.

Very nice design of the wiki and the presentation! You have also used a very innovative approach using electrical impulses in a chain reaction to degrade PET. It combines different molecular methods such as the Cre-LoxP system, the kill switch and the development of a fusion enzyme, which could be useful in different applications besides environmental problems. The planned future applications are also very well thought out and described in detail, which makes the project feasible. Impressively, you have done a lot of human practice and integrated it into your decision making at various stages. This is an important aspect of iGem! Also, you all know what you have done and why you have done it, which shows your great commitment to this project. Great! Please keep up the good work on this promising project!

**Constructive Feedback**

There is hardly anything to criticise in your project. However, it would have been good if you had been more transparent about your failures. It is always good to show this, as future iGem teams working with your project will make the same "mistakes" or encounter the same problems. It would also help to understand why you chose certain steps, organisms or molecules to make it work.

This was a truly impressive project! You have a well-engineered solution to a global problem. Great description of the more detailed aspects of material recycling. You accomplished a significant amount in the lab, and everything was clearly presented and well documented. The modeling efforts were excellent, and the generation of variants/mutants in silico was a great addition to your project. Human Practices work stood out for it's thoroughness and engagement of a diverse array of stakeholders, and clear articulation of/reflection on what was learned from each interaction. Summary graphic on the HP page was also helpful in tying the various aspects of your project together.

**Constructive Feedback**

Overall, your documentation of your parts in the registry is very well done. Based on all your work, these parts have the potential to be useful to other teams, and if you were able to add or reference your experimental protocols, it may make it easier for them to be built upon (For example, see: https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa\_K863005).

The iGEM Waseda-Tokyo teamâ€™s Wiki showcases an impressive breadth and depth of work, clearly highlighting the large scope of their project and the extensive efforts involved. The range of activities, from gene circuit modeling to protein simulation, biosafety measures, hardware development, and human practices, demonstrates a highly multidisciplinary approach. The integration of machine learning for protein evolution and in silico screening shows cutting-edge innovation, and the team's extensive experimental work to validate their designs is commendable. Their focus on public engagement through human practices, especially with innovative approaches like the VTuber live stream, indicates a strong commitment to making science accessible. The overall structure of the Wiki is logical and organized, making it easy to follow each component of the project. This is an outstanding example of an ambitious iGEM project that not only tackles real-world challenges but also pushes the boundaries of synthetic biology research through creative solutions and thorough experimentation.

While the Wiki is comprehensive, certain sections could benefit from additional clarity and focus. In the modeling pages, for example, some of the equations and technical details may be difficult for non-experts to follow. Adding more visual aids or simplifying explanations could make the content more accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, the results from the various experiments and simulations, while extensive, could be better summarized at the end of each section, with key takeaways highlighted more explicitly. In some cases, the outcomes of the work (such as the limitations faced in experiments) could be discussed in more depth to show how the team plans to address these challenges in future iterations. Lastly, while the human practices and outreach are well-integrated, expanding on how the public feedback specifically influenced project decisions could further strengthen this section. Overall, more attention to accessibility and summarization would enhance the presentation of the team's impressive achievements.

**Positive Feedback**

it is a well thought and well-designed project the team is active and we feel the team spirit, already before entering the room Answers to questions are mostly well-formulated The wiki is clear, although some designs are a bit too heavy (first page in particular)

**Constructive Feedback**

\- it's is an excellent project, but you lack a bit of long-term vision and implementation to score at the highest scale. - It is always important to think from start at what you want at the 'real scale' when you start a project. the product-fit is the most important step. It's ok not to have time to test everything as you only have a year, but you can expand your vision by some calculations! - when you answer questions: it is great to have support slides, but it's usually not needed. Jurors can understand without visual support if you explain well. It removes stress from you while you try to find the right slide, and doesn't disturb the jurors who are checking what you wanna show.

#### Judge 6

**Positive Feedback**

I am very impressed by your project. The way you arranged your design and model was thoughtfully and easy to follow. You went great lengths and performed several impressive models that were transparent and usable for future teams. Even tough it is hard to summarize all the work in a 15 min presentation, it was easy to follow and informative. The Human Practice effort was thoughtful and detailed. I loved the modular approach of you design! You also did a great job in the judging session. Your team spirit is outstanding and you seemed to enjoy the challenge and experience. Your explaination was very clear. I loved how you interpreted your wet lab data and looked at it from several different angles. Good transperancy of potential weak data and nice proposals of how do improve. Good job everyone, overall a really impressive project and best of luck for your future in synbio!

**Constructive Feedback**

I would have liked some insights into the way you processed your raw data, so the axes of your plots are more meaningful. The same goes for some measurements, for example: The way you performed the gravimetric measurements of your PET pellets. Were they dried after the catalysis? What was the posttreatment? Another point that was missing for me was your outlook. What specifically would you change in your design for the next engineering cycle? What would be experiments that would fix some issues?
